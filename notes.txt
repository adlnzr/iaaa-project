missmatch between preds in the two files:

test_file: preds = (outputs > self.threshold).float()
train_file: preds = (sigmoid(outputs) > self.threshold).float()

it is supposed there is no sigmoid in last layer of the model so 
sigmoid is needed for preds and loss is: BCEWithlogits 

new dataset class has been added to avoid the unbalanced dataset: BalancedMRIDataset
original labels ratio (MRIDatset): 20 to 80
new labels ratio (BalancedMRIDataset): 42 to 58

image channels: 20 (mri images for each patient)
models.py and train.py and test.py now contain class for 1-channel dataset

as the last layer of the models are just linear functions it sounds fine 
BCEWithlogits for the loss functions
for the data entry for the metrics, model output might works better with sigmid
